# MadLabyrinth
The whole point of this game is to find the exit in all the levels. This gets progressively more difficult as you need to collect key-like boxes that unlock certain paths and avoid red blocks whenever you can, as they will kill you on contact.


Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move.
